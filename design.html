        <h3>This document highlights all the design choices made to create this website.</h3>
        <p>The Cipher Madness website is highly influenced by flat design. During development,
        the aim was to stay modern, elegant, and make the content easy to digest.</p>
        <p>The style and block-like build is consistent throughout the whole website, yet
        there is a natural divide between every web-page. Every Cipher page has its own colour theme,
        while staying true to the pastel range and a similar layout. Most elements
        are only one color or introduce a very slight gradient. You will find that the
        rest of the website is simply grey. This was done to emphasise the focus
        on the cipher pages.
        <br>There are several instances of animations applied to single elements as well as whole
        containers. The animated pop-up of the page content is consistant throughout every page.</p>
        <h3 class="grayText">Below we will discuss design choices made on single elements.</h3>
        <div class="designItem">
          <div class="designItemLeftSide">
            <div class="">
              <h1 class="grayText" id="elem1">Head1</h1>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            The Heading 1 is the most dominant element used throughout the website.
            It's using 65 pixel sized Arial Bold. The rest of the site uses Arial as well.
            H1, however, is by far the most eye-catching due to its size and therefore is
            used sparingly.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">
          <div class="designItemLeftSide">
            <div class="">
              <h2 class="grayText" id="elem2">Head2</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            Heading 2, as opposed to H1, is not used for decorative purposes. With the font size of
            28 pixels, it's used as the top element of every cipher page, so it doesn't attract as much
            attention as an H1.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">

          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            The Heading 3 styling uses a bold Arial of size 20 pixels. It is only slightly smaller
            than an H2, and serves a practical purpose of highlighting small titles or
            naming input fields. It is the lowest level heading used on the website and the
            last to use bold text. Paragraphs all use a normal font weight with an occasional
            strong tag.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">

          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            Solid, coloured boxes are used as text containers throughout the page.
            For every cipher, this color is different, the rest of the website uses gray
            boxes. Regardless of the background colour, all of them use white for the font.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">
          <div class="designItemLeftSide">

          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            Interactivity on the previously mentioned elements is represented by a
            pointer cursor when hovering as well as a change in colour. The opacity
            of the background goes from 0.8-ish (value used for most containers) to a
            solid 1. The colour change transitions for less than half a second, giving
            a sophisticated feel to the element.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">

          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            As mentioned previously, all ciphers have their own color theme. These
            colors were chosen purely based on personal taste. To keep it consistent,
            all of them are not too saturated and almost pastel-like. The corresponding
            ciphers to the colors (left to right) are: Transposition, Sanctus Notis,
            Binary.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">

            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            Most solid coloured elements use an ever so slight background shadow.
            Contrary to common sense, this underlines the flat design of the webpage,
            showing how stacked the 2D layers are. The pop-up animations compliment this
            property as well.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">
          <div class="designItemLeftSide">

            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            To keep the design minimalistic, the input fields lost all borders and outlines.
            The only element indicating the input field is a top bar, containing an H3 to name
            the field. This H3 uses block capitals with a bigger letter-spacing. The bottom part,
            including the textarea's placeholder, uses larger text to demonstrate dominance on the
            page.

          </div>

          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            The navbar, which is placed on top of the page is one of the most interactive
            elements. To indicate being hovered over, items inverse colors so that the
            text becomes dark and the background brightens. After selected, the font of the
            item increases in size a little and the background takes the function of a highlight,
            making sure the viewer knows where they are.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="designItem">

            The dropdown box, which is also part of the navbar, groups together all the
            ciphers under one element. This was done so that the navbar doesn't feel too
            cluttered, and it also gives the webpage a more professional feel.
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="designItemLRightSide">
            Each page also has a different background to keep loyal to the color theme.
            Every background consists of a slight linear gradient and a low opacity
            element placed on top of it. This element is a design decision that is most representative
            of the cipher's essence, in a way. In the case of binary code, the whole window is covered
            in a matrix of 1's and 0's. For Transposition, large text with shuffled
            characters are used; and Sanctus Notis uses the only picture on the whole site -
            a pair of praying hands.
          </div>

        <div class="">
          <p>Lastly, the design of the Design Document itself is supposed to imitate a
          physical document, a notepad. To keep the flat design, it ommits a huge amount of
          detail compared to a photorealistic image.
          <br>As you may see, the site as a whole puts a big emphasis on the design and every
          choice was made with consideration to the minimalistic and flat direction.
